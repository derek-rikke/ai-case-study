# Figure.ai

### A Case Study 
### By Derek Rikke

In the United States, there are 7 million job openings in warehouse and manufacturing positions and only 6 million people available to fill these roles. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce “even if every unemployed person with experience in the durable goods manufacturing industry were employed, the industry would fill only around 75% of vacant jobs.” Tech giant Amazon says that it could run out of people to hire by 2024. In short, the U.S. is facing a looming labor shortage, a trend that will only worsen as the baby boomer generation exits the workforce. Enter Figure.ai, an AI robotics company building general purpose humanoid robots to supplement and eliminate repetitive, undesirable and dangerous jobs.

Figure.ai was founded in 2022 by CEO Brett Adcock. Adcock had previously founded and sold hiring platform Vettery (now Hired.com) as well as Archer Aviation, an electric air taxi company that recently went public (2.7B IPO). Emerging AI and robotics technologies combined with the aforementioned labor shortage resulted in the creation of Figure.ai, which Adcock started with his profits from Archer as well as $79 million raised in two rounds of funding in 2023. Figure is seeking to maximize its utility impact on humanity by creating general purpose humanoid robots to first eliminate the need for unsafe and undesirable jobs then provide living assistance and elderly care and eventually perform tasks on other planets.

As competitors in the field such as Amazon design robots to automate tasks in a specific environment, Figure chooses to focus on humanoid robots powered by AI that will thrive in our current human-optimized environment to have the largest overall impact. AI technologies necessary for the project include multi-camera deep neural networks to locate, track and identify objects around it, similar to self-driving cars, neural net planning to problem solve and optimize movements, and automated data labeling. I would additionally recomend using AI to monitor the condition of the robots to minimize down time as well as using AI to allow the robots to collaborate on tasks to complete them with more efficiency.

Figure’s team of researchers and roboticists, sourced from high profile companies such as Boston Dynamics, Apple, Google, Tesla and others, just released the [first glimpse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4erYt2t7Bs) of their prototype Figure 01 taking its first steps. Competitors 1X and Apptronik have also taken their first steps and all three major players are looking to test their products and get them on factory floors in 2024. As a person with over a half decade of warehouse and manufacturing experience, I can personally attest to the high attrition and injury rate of people in the field. Figure.ai is taking us one step closer to the day that people will no longer be antiquated cogs in the economic machine, but rather the harvesters of the fruits of human ambition and inspiration.
